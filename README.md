This code demonstrates a scenario where TypeScript fails to detect that a loop might not run to completion due to an early return statement. The function `printNumbers1` includes an `if` condition that prematurely exits the loop if the counter `i` equals 3. Although this behavior is perfectly valid JavaScript, TypeScript doesn't flag it as a potential issue because its type checking doesn't analyze control flow to this depth.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a possible way to improve code clarity.
